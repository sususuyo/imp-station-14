  You've just been chosen to be a nuclear operative for the [color=#ff0000]Syndicate[/color]. You have one goal, to blow up one of Nanotrasen's finest vessels with a nuclear fission explosive.

  ## Operatives
  Your team will be made up of several different roles, which are:
  - [bold]Operatives[/bold], standard soldiers who can take up the grunt work.
  - The [bold]Agent[/bold] who works with reagents to make medicines or chemical weapons.
  - The [bold]Commander[/bold] who draws up the plan and leads the team.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingOuterHardsuitSyndieCommander" Caption="commander's hardsuit"/>
  </Box>

  If you have been selected as the Agent or Commander but don't feel ready, one of your teammates can take responsibility.

  ## The Disk

  Each operative starts with a [color=cyan]pinpointer[/color], which you should turn on and keep with you at all times. It will always point to the [color=cyan]nuclear authentication disk.[/color]
  The disk belongs to the [color=yellow]Captain[/color], who will almost always have it on them. Follow the direction of the arrow on the pinpointer to the disk, and [italic]do whatever it takes to get it[/italic].

  ## Preparation
  Each member in your squad has been given an [color=cyan]uplink[/color] to purchase everything you will need for the mission, similar to [textlink="traitors." link="Traitors"]

  You can purchase the same kinds of gear traitors can, but you have higher quality gear available to you and more telecrystals to spend.

  </Box>

  You'll also have to choose if you want to [color=red]declare war[/color] or not. Doing so grants your team [bold]40 extra telecrystals each[/bold].
  However, the crew will immediately know of your existence and will have plenty of time to prepare for your arrival.

  The [bold]Commander[/bold] is the only person who can declare war. Make your choice quick, [italic]this is a limited-time offer![/italic]

  ## Getting to the Station
  You've got the plan, you've got the gear. Now, execute.

  Grab a [bold]jetpack[/bold] from your armory and go with your other operatives to your [color=cyan]shuttle[/color].
  Among other things you may need, you'll find an [bold]IFF Computer[/bold] on the shuttle. It allows you to hide from other ships and mass scanners when [italic]Show IFF[/italic] and [italic]Show Vessel[/italic] are toggled off.

  When everyone is ready, FTL to the station and fly to it with a jetpack. Don't forget the code, your pinpointers and the nuke if you're taking it.

  ## The Nuke & Arming Procedure
  You have a paper with the [color=cyan]nuclear authentication codes[/color] on your shuttle. [bold]Check to see if the nuke ID matches the one on your shuttle.[/bold] If it doesn't, you'll be arming the station's nuke instead.

  - Obtain the [bold]nuclear authentication disk[/bold] and insert it into the nuke.
  - Type in the [bold]nuclear authentication code[/bold] and press "[bold]E[/bold]" on the keypad to Enter.
  - [bold]To begin the self-destruct sequence, press [color=#EB2D3A]ARM[/color][/bold]. After 300 seconds, the nuke will explode.
  - [bold]Defend the nuke[/bold], even if it's at the cost of your lives! The mission requirements do not include your return.
  - It takes 30 seconds for someone to [bold]disarm[/bold] the nuke. Re-arming it is possible, but the chance of mission success drops if you let it happen.
  - Should the nuke be re-armed, the timer will start from where it left off.
